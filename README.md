# When-Pigs-Fly-v-2.0
 
If you want to just play the game then download the WhenPigsFly.zip file (You can download the files individually if you want but just safer to download the zip)
To see the code or 3d models you can either download their respective zip files (source code & source FBX)
or open up their respective folders (scripts & FBXs)
in game instructions available by pressing h for help
Everything made by me except for sound and FBXs (I do have the skill to make the FBXs and did assist in the making of them but my partner Bisho Pramanik was the one who made those)
